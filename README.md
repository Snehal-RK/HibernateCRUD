## Overview

This web application demonstrates my proficiency in building **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities** using a combination of **Java Servlets and Hibernate**. It showcases a solid understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern in a Java web environment, where Servlets handle the request-response cycle and business logic, while Hibernate manages data persistence. The user interface is built with **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** for dynamic views and styled with **Bootstrap** for a responsive design.

This project effectively highlights my skills in:

* **Java Web Development:** Utilizing Java Servlets for handling HTTP requests and responses, managing application flow, and implementing business logic.
* **Hibernate ORM:** Mapping Java objects to database tables, performing data access operations, and managing database interactions efficiently.
* **MVC Architecture:** Implementing a clear separation of concerns between the model (Hibernate entities), the view (JSP pages), and the controller (Servlets).
* **Database Interaction:** Configuring and interacting with a relational database through Hibernate.
* **Frontend Development:** Employing JSP for dynamic content generation and Bootstrap for creating a user-friendly interface.

## Project Information

* **Language:** Java
* **Web Component:** Java Servlets
* **ORM Framework:** Hibernate
* **View Technology:** JSP (JavaServer Pages)
* **Frontend Framework:** Bootstrap
* **Configuration:** Hibernate Configuration File (`hibernate.cfg.xml`), Web Application Deployment Descriptor (`web.xml` or Servlet annotations)
* **Functionality:** Implements full CRUD operations on a sample entity, managed by Servlets and persisted using Hibernate.

## Features

* **Create (Servlet Handling):** A Servlet receives user input from a form and uses Hibernate to persist the new record in the database.
* **Read (Servlet Handling):** A Servlet retrieves data from the database using Hibernate and forwards it to a JSP page for display.
* **Update (Servlet Handling):** A Servlet processes user updates to an existing record and uses Hibernate to update the database.
* **Delete (Servlet Handling):** A Servlet handles requests to delete a record and utilizes Hibernate to remove it from the database.
* **Hibernate Integration:** Demonstrates the seamless integration of Hibernate within Servlets for data management, including session management and transaction handling.
* **MVC Implementation:** Clearly separates request handling (Servlets), data access (Hibernate), and presentation (JSP).
* **Basic UI:** A clean and responsive user interface built with Bootstrap, providing an intuitive way to interact with the CRUD operations.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The core programming language for the application's backend, including Servlets and Hibernate entities.
* **Java Servlets:** Used as the controller component to handle HTTP requests, manage application logic, and interact with the Hibernate layer.
* **Hibernate:** An object-relational mapping framework that simplifies database interactions.
* **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** Used for creating dynamic web pages that display data retrieved by Servlets.
* **Bootstrap:** A CSS framework for responsive and aesthetically pleasing frontend design.
* **MySQL:** The relational database used for data persistence.
* **Apache Tomcat:** The server environment used to deploy and run the web application, providing the Servlet container.

## Overview

This project is a web application developed to showcase my skills in **Java web development** with a focus on **Hibernate ORM** for data persistence and **Java Servlets** for handling business logic and the request-response cycle. It implements core **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities**, providing a practical example of building a database-backed web interface using JSP for dynamic views and Bootstrap for basic styling.
